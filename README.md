##Term Project
The team plan to complete the project by 25th March 2024

### The problems to solve: 
1. **Calculate Yearly Averages (1760-2015):**
   - Based on the land average temperature column, calculate the yearly averages for each year between 1760 and 2015 (the average of the twelve months of each year). One average per year. Ignore the years 1750-1759.

2. **Calculate Century Averages:**
   - Based on the land average temperature column, calculate the average land temperature for the different centuries: 18th century (1760-1799), 19th century (1800-1899), 20th century (1900-1999), and 21st century (2000-2015). One average per century.

3. **Calculate Monthly Averages (1900-2015):**
   - Based on the land average temperature column, calculate the monthly averages for each month for all years combined between 1900 and 2015. A total of twelve averages. One average per month.

4. **Identify Hottest and Coldest Months:**
   - Based on the land average temperature column, determine the hottest and coldest months recorded (month and year). In case of a tie, mention only one.

5. **Identify Hottest and Coldest Years:**
   - Based on the yearly averages calculated in question 1, determine the hottest and coldest years.

6. **Generate GNUPlot Graph for Yearly Temperatures (1760-2015):**
   - Generate a GNUPlot data file and plot a graph (line plot) of the yearly temperatures for the years 1760 to 2015. Label the axes clearly and add a title and legend to your graph.

7. **Generate GNUPlot Graph for 19th and 20th Century Temperatures:**
   - Generate a GNUPlot data file and plot line plots of the average land temperatures for the 19th and 20th centuries on the same figure. Ensure both lines have the same x-axis scale. Label the axes clearly and add a title and legend to your graph.

8. **Generate GNUPlot Graph for Land Temperatures (1850-2015):**
   - Generate a GNUPlot data file and plot line plots showing LandAverageTemperature, LandMaxTemperature, and LandMinTemperature on the same figure for the years between 1850 and 2015. Use different colors or line styles for distinction. Ensure clear labels, a title, and a legend.

9. **Generate GNUPlot Graph for Century Temperatures (1850-2015):**
   - Generate a GNUPlot data file and create four bar plots (box or histogram plots) showing the average, low, and high temperatures for each of the four centuries (18th, 19th, 20th, and 21st). Display all plots as subplots with a title for the figure and century names on each subplot. Include a legend on each subplot.

10. **Generate GNUPlot Error Bar Graph (2000-2015):**
   - For the years 2000 to 2015, generate a GNUPlot data file and plot an error bar plot of the average land temperature by month using the uncertainty column for land temperatures to draw the error bars.

11. **Generate GNUPlot Graph for Land and Ocean Temperatures (1850-2015):**
   - Generate a GNUPlot data file and plot a graph similar to question 6 but for the years 1850 to 2015, including data for LandAndOceanAverageTemperatures column. Plot both lines on the same figure, with clear labels, a title, and a legend.
